# Basic-ISA
This repository contains implementations of Signed and Unsigned Addition, Subtraction of 32-bit integers as well as code for converting a floating point number (written in IEEE 754) format to a 32-bit integer and vice-versa.
Input file(given as a command-line argument) contains the assembly instructions to for the above mentioned operations.
Output file contains the corresponding results and the state of the flag register, which includes the carry bit, the overflow bit, the zero bit and the negative bit.
